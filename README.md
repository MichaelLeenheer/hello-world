**ha!** That's gonna be messy.  Or possibly slow.  

*Still ... going ok, so far. I can make a text file with markdown elements. Whee.*

I'm guessing that hitting enter will make a blank line, in this context, but it doesn't in typical code so is this Markdown gonna work like a text editor or will it need a <br> element or something?  ... probably not.

That's enough for now.
